This repo will contain an entire web page from a design provided by The Odin Project.
The goal of this project will be to demonstrate what I have learned about web design using HTML and CSS so far from The Odin Project's Foundations course. In particular, this landing page will use flexboxes to create a responsive design.

All photos used on this web page were taken from bishopvids' ["HASTILY MADE CLEVELAND TOURISM VIDEO"] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysmLA5TqbIY)
